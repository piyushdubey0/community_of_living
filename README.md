# community_of_living
A "community of living" refers to a collective of individuals or organisms coexisting and interacting within a shared environment. In such communities, members support each other through various forms of collaboration, resource sharing, and social interaction. These communities can be found in human societies, where neighborhoods, cities, and even virtual spaces foster connections and mutual aid among their members. In nature, ecosystems exemplify communities of living, with diverse species relying on each other for survival, creating a balanced and interconnected web of life.
